## Chain Of Responsibility Method Design Pattern
- Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. 
- Later, the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.

## Command Method Design Pattern
- A behavioral design pattern called the Command Pattern transforms a request into an independent object with all of the information's request
- This object can be passed around, stored, and executed at a later time.

## Observer Method Design Pattern
- It establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, meaning that all of the dependents (observers) of the subject are immediately updated and notified when the subject changes.

## Strategy Method Design Pattern
- It is possible to select an object's behavior at runtime by utilizing the Strategy Design Pattern.
- Encapsulating a family of algorithms into distinct classes that each implement a common interface is the foundation of the Strategy pattern.

## Template Method Design Pattern
- The template method design pattern defines an algorithm as a collection of skeleton operations, with the child classes handling the implementation of the specifics.
- The parent class maintains the overall structure and flow of the algorithm.
