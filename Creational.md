## Simple Factory & Factory Method
- This pattern is typically helpful when it's necessary to separate the construction of an object from its implementation.
- With the use of this design pattern, objects can be produced without having to define the exact class of object to be created.

## Abstract Factory Method
- Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern and is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern.
- Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.

## Builder Method 
- To “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.” Builder pattern is used
- It helps in constructing a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object.

## Prototype Method
- Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client.
- The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations.

## Singleton Method 
- It guarantees that a class has just one instance and offers a way to access it globally.
