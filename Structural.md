## Adapter Pattern
- The adapter pattern convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
## Bridge Pattern
- The bridge pattern allows the Abstraction and the Implementation to be developed independently.
- The client code can access only the Abstraction part without being concerned about the Implementation part.
## Composite Pattern
- As a partitioning design pattern, the composite pattern characterizes a collection of items that are handled the same way as a single instance of the same type of object.
- The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
## Decorator Pattern
- It allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects within the same class. 
- We use inheritance to extend the behavior of the class. This takes place at compile-time, and all the instances of that class get the extended behavior.
## Facade Pattern
- Facade Method Design Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- Facade defines a high-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
## Proxy Pattern
- Proxy means ‘in place of’, representing’ or ‘in place of’ or ‘on behalf of’ are literal meanings of proxy and that directly explains Proxy Design Pattern.
- Proxies are also called surrogates, handles, and wrappers. They are closely related in structure, but not purpose, to Adapters and Decorators.
